 # summary -
 
 This is the API for the DSA/Petful project for thinkful's DSA module. 
 This API includes a Linked list queue for users of the petful application to join, progress through the queue, and adopt a pet from the FIFO petful adoption agency. 
 
 the linked list follows a queueing algorithm that allows for a user to join at the end of the linked list and advance to the front (head) of the list as other users make their selection. 
 
 this API also follows the same queue structure for housing pet information. only the first cat or dog in the queue is allowed to be adopted, and as an animal is picked, that animal is removed from the queue, and the next in line is shown available.
